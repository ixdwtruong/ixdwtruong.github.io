## Development Update

<br>

We initially started with using PlayCanvas as it worked well with our idea of integrating the six digital media artifacts. It was web-based, so we wanted to link the social media easily within the game and then back seamlessly. The idea here is that:

<br>

* The player would interact with the dialogue
* The player will then be given a set of choices
* Each choice is a specific path of the story with a different ending
* A certain choice will push the player to social media to find clues and further understand the character’s motives
* From the clues, the players deduct where they should go from there

<br>

With PlayCanvas, we encountered challenges with developing the interactions more so than creating the environments. Since PlayCanvas uses Javascript and has a similar interface to Unity, it wasn’t too hard to grasp but there were certain things like lack of documentation which were roadblocks during the development process.

<br>

![image](/images/narp21.png)
<i>Trying to get the interactions and raycasting working in PlayCanvas was difficult</i>

<br>

Mid-way into development, we decided to pivot and go back to Unity as we weren’t able to get the interactions working properly. There were issues with integrating the HTML/CSS UI with raycasting and enabling dialogue. Since there wasn’t enough documentation on this topic and how the engine works regarding UI, we moved back to Unity as there were proper documentation and tutorials that we could follow.

<br>

![image](/images/narp22.png)
<i>Since the code was in Javascript, some aspects of the code was understandable.</i>

<br>

This changed how our digital media artifacts were to be integrated, since that is changed, we decided to move towards a similar direction:

<br>

* The player would immediately know that there are choices and routes in the game, via the menu/intro screen
* This would prompt the player to go on to the social media platforms (digital artifacts) to find hints in regards to the alternative routes
* Player then would find the hints, understand the background of the characters, and then apply them within the game
* Player would need to find the specific item that would activate that alternative route
* Player chooses whether if he/she goes to the main route or the alternative route

<br>

Instead of linking each scene individually, we decided to put all scenes into one project and move the player from scene to scene. This makes the overall experience seamless, as the player is just moving around instead of clicking a lot of links. This gives us the ability to manage all the scenes better as everything is in one place instead of multiple project links.

<br>

![image](/images/narp23.png)
<i>Eventually there will be over 20 scenes but doesn't impact load times too much.</i>

<br>

## Audience/Narrative Integration Update

<br>

With the audience and narrative integration, we moved forward with our original concept of different endings. We created alternative paths or rather, “what if”, for different scenes.

<br>

![image](/images/narp24.png)

<br>

![image](/images/narp25.png)

<br>

Integration with the digital media artifacts was changed a bit as players would do a “scavenger hunt” to find alternative paths. The decision of choosing which path to go is still up to the player. For our digital artifacts, we chose:

<br>

* Twitter
* Facebook
* Instagram
* QR Codes
* Digital Comic/Graphic Novel
* Reddit

<br>

With this part of the project, we decided to integrate Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. Each platform would have a character’s social media: Hydel - Twitter, Dionne - Facebook, and Sephani - Instagram. Each character would have their posts, showing the player their background, motives, and further understanding of their personality. At the same time, they would provide clues for a particular alternative path for the player to discover.

<br>

For the social media, each of our team members (Kenzie, Jody, and Marlee) drew the profile pictures and actual characters to be posted. They are primarily sketches for the time being due to time, but for the final product, we will be refining them further with full colour art. We also added a bit of "flavour" to each of the character's social media, portraying how they would act in actual real life. As previously mentioned before, it gives more background and personality so that the player can empathize with them further.

<br>

## Project Management Update

<br>

Our schedule that we had created is as follows:

<br>

* Week 6: Finalize assets and start building environments
* Reading week: Work on building environments
* Week 7-8: Complete all environments, integrate three digital media platforms, start researching into physical media integration
* Week 9 (PROJECT 2 DUE): Start testing and complete documentation for Project 2

<br>

Unfortunately, we had to change to Unity in week 7 - Which pushed everything to around a week. Although, we spread out the work very evenly as some team members were working on the social media implementation, story/dialogue, and others were working on re-building the environments in Unity.

<br>

Even though we had a setback, we feel that we are still on track to completing the project on time. Using pre-existing assets from the Unity store helped greatly with re-making the environments. With the spreading of the duties and tasks, we managed to complete a beta version of the narrative as per Project 2. Being in constant contact and having weekly check-ins also helped with the organization and ensuring that everyone is on the same page.

## Project Concept (Project 1)

<br>

## Overview

<br>

The team Horae Studios will be creating an interactive narrative based on the Greek mythology of Hades and Persephone. Using virtual reality as a key platform, several digital media artifacts and a physical artifact, the viewer will experience a fantasy story that revolves around the idea of sacrifice and love with choices that the viewer must make to carve their own version of the story.

<br>

## Project Management Plan

<br>

<b>Skills assessment (individual, group and reflection)</b>

<br>

<a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/int_narrative/Horae_Team_Skill_Assessment.xlsx">Click to download</a>

<br>

A skills assessment was done to understand the team’s weaknesses and strengths. Overall, the team has strong design, UI/UX, and ideation skills but is weak in the secondary skills regarding coding, computational media, and 3D modeling. In order to combat this weakness, we’ll be utilizing pre-made assets to complete the product and if necessary - Creating our own but in a low-poly format so that it is easy to implement. We feel that as a team, we have good strengths regarding the narrative and is confident that we can create a great interactive narrative in VR.

## Narrative Platform Proposal

<br>

<b>Story Synopsis</b>

<br>

After many years of famine and destruction, the world finally divided into two worlds. Sephani, a young beautiful woman, is fathered by the most powerful ruler in all of the lands. Titled as the fae princess of vegetation, she has been granted the ability to bring plant life back from the dead while always growing her crops to perfection. Her mother has always deemed to protect her until one day; Sephani discovers a rare flower that makes love potions. Even though Sephani had been experiencing odd occurrences when entering the forest, she felt as if it was her duty to make the best remedies from the large forest so her village may live long and healthy. 

<br>

Though Sephani’s mother, Dionne taught her well, Sephani manages to go too far into the forest where she encounters the grand ruler of the underworld. With his skin as deep as ash and his hair in a fiery blaze, the handsome king stands tall over Sephani making a fierce impression. Injured and helpless, Sephani is swept away from her home. The king of the underworld brings death wherever he may go but Sephani believes the bond they may develop can bring the worlds together once and for all. With a high level of uncertainty, will Sephani remain with the dark king, or find a way to venture back to her familiar kingdom alongside her mother?

<br>

## Themes, narrative arc, main goal, duration, primary audience (demographics)

<br>

<b>Art Direction and Inspiration</b>

<br>

The story is based on the Greek mythology Hades and Persephone, using the key themes of love between both two people romantically and then a mother and daughter bond.
We are telling this story through a thriller fantasy setting to help show the dark side of manipulation. Which is why it matters because it’s a great example about manipulation, the two sides to someone and how they come in many different forms. 

<br>

Using creatures like characters, we found a great opportunity to tell the story from the victims eyes and allow us to have full creative freedom with twists. Is she really a victim here? Or is the true victim here the mother?

<br>

<b>Primary Audience (demographics)</b>

<br>

The primary audience for our interactive narrative is young adults to adults, around 20-40 years old. This is because this age range is technologically savvy and since VR has a large barrier of entry (i.e. you have to buy the headset and such), we feel that this age range is familiar with VR and it’s technologies.

<br>

Although, we feel that other demographics beyond the young-adult/adult demographic can equally enjoy our interactive narrative. This is because with the advances of VR and how accessible it is today with such means like Google Cardboard, the Oculus Quest 2, and even in mobile - It is easy for other demographics to get access to VR technology.

<br>

## Story outline (brief) 

<br>

In the early summer, Sephani and her mother are tending to crops and bringing back life into the nature that surrounds them. Sephani grew up as a happy fae child; she enjoyed the company of other children like her and even the rare ogre child. She never once asked about her father because she knew secretly who he was and did not want a serious relationship with him. Being invested in the acts of herbal magic like her mother, Sephani ventured off into the forest to her favourite spot by the waterfall. She had been experiencing odd occurrences when she’d go off into the forest to find flowers and plants for medicine or food but she felt determined to find her ingredients. Finally, she discovers a rare plant required for love potions, but as she is picking them she feels an unfamiliar presence. She calls out to her mother and hears no response.

<br>

Suddenly, Sephani hears whispers that caress her senses and suddenly she feels cold. She turns slowly to see the underworld king before her and she is so frightened that she cannot scream. Even she was unaware that the king of the underworld was in fact a dark elf. As Hydel towers over her, she stands to flee but she quickly trips and becomes injured. Hydel watches her from a distance and approaches slowly but Sephani is terrified. Hydel examines Sephani’s injury and he picks her up in his arms and raises his hand to part the waterfall with his power. Sephani is in awe and begs to be put down but all Hydel can do is look into her eyes. Without saying a word, Hydel jumps down into the cracked earth with Sephani in his arms. The earth seals the passage slowly. 

<br>

Dionne realizes her daughter’s presence has disappeared and she looks to the sky to see a murder of crows erupting through the branches and leaves of the forest. Dionne fears the worst and runs into the forest to where her daughter used to be. In agony, Dionne cries out for her daughter, panicked and emitting rage through her veins. All she could find were the scattered flowers and berries where her daughter once stood. In her potent rage, Dionne brought out drought to the land including her own. Everything became dry and the land in this side of the world was now barren. Snow eventually begins to fall.

<br>

Now in the underworld, Sephani sat quietly against a rock. Hydel glanced briefly at her before he reached down and pulled her pain into him. He barely winced from it then rose up and stepped away from her. Sephani noticed that her wound was completely healed and the man that once stood over her was no longer seen as a threat. Sephani approached Hydel, he was tall and very handsome. However, his title is what made most fear him. Sephani thanks Hydel cautiously but he just simply nods at her and looks away from her glance. Hydel refused to answer her questions until she attempted to leave by climbing up the walls. Sephani loses her footing and begins to fall but Hydel is there at the bottom ready to catch her. Sephani explains that her mother would not be happy that she has been kidnapped and demands to be let go. Hydel can only stare in awe as she quarrels; her beautiful appearance only immobilizes him. 

<br>

Sephani notices that Hydel has not said a word since they arrived in the underworld. Hydel pulls her closer and they lock eyes. Hydel's voice is deep and suits his appearance. He states that he had been admiring Sephani from afar and taken aback by her beauty, he did not know when to approach her. He explains his life before her and how he needs her help in the underworld. Sephani could feel Hydel’s urgency, his loneliness. She sensed that there was more to it than what he had told her. Sephani locks eyes with him once more and states sternly to Hydel that if she is to be his wife then he must not lie to her. Hydel takes her hands and tells her to close her eyes as his eyes illuminate, this is how Hydel shows her the history of his reign through visions. 

<br>

As soon as the visions are over, Sephani nearly faints from exhaustion. Suddenly, the dark elves of the underworld emerge and circle around them. Sephani grips onto Hydel’s arm tightly but he reassures and tells her that they’ve been observing since she arrived. They could not believe that a fae was willing to help them.  For the next four months, Sephani helped rebuild their community and spoke on their behalf as a fae woman. Eventually, Sephani’s appearance changes but not enough to go unnoticed by other faes. Hydel notices that the faes look down on Sephani for marrying him; they start to blame her for the land’s inability to grow vegetation, rendering Sephani confused. With great urgency, the pair leaves.

<br>

Hydel takes Sephani to her village and he returns to the underworld after leaving her there. Sephani is concerned because all she can see is dead vegetation and snowfall. Sephani looks around for her mother only to find a statue of her resemblance. Sephani is shocked by this scene and she runs to her mother’s aid. In all her efforts, she rests her hands into her mother’s and concentrates. The magic that Hydel taught her to control has now found its use. Dionne is frightened by her awakening but soon realizes that it is her daughter. 

<br>

Dionne is overwhelmed with joy and sadness, and she embraces her daughter tightly. Sephani explains what has occurred and that her blood is required to create a potion in response to the ongoing war. Dionne is furious not only by Sephani’s inability to return home after it was possible, but also the fact that she got married to the dark king. Dionne is convinced that Sephani has been manipulated by Hydel but Sephani defends his actions. For the next few days, Sephani stays with her mother and they restore the earth together. However, while Sephani is away from the underworld, an attack is issued on Hydel. Hydel is injured very badly and Sephani senses this. Sephani promises her mom to return once harmony has been restored among both kingdoms. Dionne is devastated by the result, however, she agrees because she can see her daughter’s happiness.  Sephani embraces her mother tightly and looks at her once more before disappearing underground.

<br>

Due to Sephani’s overbearing need to help Hydel, her magic becomes tainted and she suddenly becomes a dark fae. Her eyes glow brightly and the darkness consumes her. Sephani has the choice to either save all of humanity or destroy the other side of the earth where she once lived. She tries to harbour her feelings but the darkness is so great, it almost kills her. Hydel is unable to help her because of his injuries but it occurs to him that the potion he needed that contained Sephani’s blood is the key to the end of this war. As Sephani causes further destruction to her own people, Hydel takes the potion and becomes a high elf. No longer tainted with darkness, Hydel’s injuries heal and he goes to Sephani so he can take the darkness back. Sephani fights back but Hydel refuses to let go. In a rash decision, Hydel embraces her and siphons the darkness from her with a kiss.

<br>

Sephani fights the darkness as well which breaks her out of her deep trance. Hydel watches as the look on Sephani’s face turns from confusion to horror. Everything they worked so hard for was completely destroyed. Hydel reassures her it can be fixed and they combine their magic as one to heal the earth to create order once again. The winter finally leaves and the earth’s vegetation is restored tenfold. With Hydel and Sephani’s reign causing a great effect, Sephani decides to make an agreement with the ruler of the light world. It takes great encouragement but eventually he agrees. Sephani returns to the surface, she is now a divine being. She approaches her mother in the garden, and smiles warmly. Closely, Hydel stands at a distance, Sephani is uncertain if her mother will accept Hydel but to her surprise, Dionne calls to him. Hydel towers over the both of them and bows honourably to Dionne. She is surprised by his interaction but states that there is much to discuss and calls them both into the family home.

Fighting to get her back she changes the season and becomes so depressed, she cannot do her job properly. She is very protective over her daughter, who not only wants the best for her but likes to have a bit of control over Sephani’s life.

<br>

## How the audience will interact with the characters

<br>

<b>Sephani (Persephone) - Character 1 (First Player)</b>

<br>

The player (or viewer) will be "Sephani" in the interactive narrative, the goal is for the audience to understand her feelings and relationship with Hydel and Dionne. In addition, the audience will form a relationship as the player goes through the story realizing her hardships of living in the underworld and the world of living.

<br>

<b>Hydel (Hades) - Character 2 (Non Playable Character)</b>

<br>

Hydel is a non-playable character and the audience will be interacting with him the most. Throughout the story, the audience will gain an understanding of Hydel's character and his love for Sephani.

<br>

<b>Dionne (Demeter) - Character 3 (Non Playable Character)</b>

<br>

Dionne is the final non-playable character in the interactive narrative, but is shown at the beginning and the end. The audience will meet her at the beginning and then she will be back towards the end.

<br>

## Identify key media piece & supporting media platforms

<br>

Our idea consists of integrating the world of visual/graphic novels with “choices”. We feel that providing choices and different end routes, like what visual novels are doing, will provide the player a sense of power as the choices that they make affect the story’s ending. In addition to this, the player can print out a summary of their choices in the form of a graphic novel and share their route via an QR code on the title page. This will provide a high level of interaction among other players, as they get to experience the choices that other players make. Other forms of sharing can be done like social media (Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram) and through online communities like Reddit. To enhance the interaction further, we want to let the player take screenshots and share them online. We want the player to create memories, just like in real life with taking photos with a mobile phone or camera.

<br>

With this in mind, we selected VR (virtual reality) as a key media piece. Our rationale for this is:

<br>

- We want to create a close relationship with the characters we will be creating, this was the reason why we selected VR as a key media platform – So the user/player can be one with the main character
- The level of interaction with the narrative is high, the user/player can do a lot. Such as picking things up, talking to NPCs, or simply immersing themselves in the world

<br>

For our six digital media artifacts, we decided to select:

<br>

- Digital Visual Novel (like a comic/graphic novel)
- Facebook
- Twitter
- Instagram
- Reddit
- QR Codes

<br>

Finally, our physical artifact would be:

<br>

- Printed comic/graphic novel

<br>

## Consider/identify risks and opportunities

<br>

<b>Risk 1: The project scope is ambitious and can fail due to the large amount of work needed to be done.</b>

<br>

- Our goal is to complete the project on time and without much issues, to ensure that this project is successful, we will be using pre-made assets in Unity or if we were to create our own – using a low-poly look in our models so it will be easy to create.
- Simplifying the story will be something we will be considering as having multiple parts to a narrative (like lots of characters), can be complicated in regards creating the script
- Simplifying the choices in the narrative, since we want to provide choices and different end routes – making this easy and narrowing down 2-3 routes would be idea and manageable. We will be doing at least 2.

<br>

<b>Risk 2: The possibility that there would be team complications (i.e. team members going missing, not doing work, and etc.)</b>

<br>

- To avoid this, each team member needs to be on the same page and understand the project deliverables.
- Ensuring that everyone’s opinions get across and ideas.
- Frequent check ins with the PM to ensure that deadlines are met

<br>

<b>Risk 3: Issues with implementing ideas/features in VR, debugging, and making it work would create long development times which we would not finish the project in time.</b>

<br>

- Keeping things simple such as the narrative and overall features would alleviate this risk greatly.
- Ensuring that testing is done early.
- Making sure that the issues in the development process is brought up early with the PM so things can be on track fast.

<br>

## KPIs (key performance indicators)

<br>

<b>KPI 1: Project schedule</b>

<br>

- Percentage of overdue/missed/completed project tasks and deadlines
- Are we working efficiently to meet deadlines for specified tasks?
- Are we taking too long on a certain task due to issues like technology or other factors?
- How much time are we using per task?

<br>

<b>KPI 2: Collaboration</b>

<br>

- Number of meetings held
- Are we meeting deadlines effectively as a group?
- Are we solving issues together as a group?

<br>

<b>KPI 3: Communication</b>

<br>

- How frequent are we communicating with each other?
- Are we helping each other when there are issues?
- How frequent are team meetings to accomplish goals and objectives?

<br>
