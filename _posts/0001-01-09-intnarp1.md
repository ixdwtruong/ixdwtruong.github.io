## Overview/Design Statement

<br>

Project 3 is an extension of the ideas that were created in project 2. The ideas and prototypes that were created, provided an insight on what project 3 would shape to be. The concept of the design matrix was integrated into researching ideas on utilizing flex sensors to activate actions (i.e. LEDs, motors, sound, etc.). With this in mind, the research done informed the design decisions to create a wearable jacket that integrates LEDs to mimic car signals (brake, left, and right indicators) which would provide a level of safety to the cyclist as he/she would be very visible. There were challenges in creating the prototype as the resources needed to do so, was not apparent due to the pandemic. The first prototype was created to inform about the challenges and the final design for the final prototype. Although, things were changed due to issues like attaching the LEDs and testing the overall prototype. If there was no pandemic and sufficient resources, other things would be added to enhance the overall experience of the prototype.

## Research and More Research

<br>

With project 3, I knew that it was an extension of project 2. I wanted to take my glove flex sensor further, but I faced a few problems as mentioned in project 2:

<br>

-	Two of my flex sensors were starting to fail, which resulted in my concluding that DIY sensors have a limited durability due to how it is constructed.
-	Using packing tape to bind the Velostat and conductive fabric, created some variance as the packing tape is somewhat rigid.

<br>

I took these things into consideration as I thought about project 3. I knew I wanted to take the flex sensor further but at the same time, I felt it was difficult to push it further as there is so much you can do with a flex sensor. This prompted in doing further research along with using the design matrix that was discussed in class.

<br>

With the design matrix, I selected a product called the Lumos Smart Bike Helmet to do my research case study. This study informed me in taking a concept that is very simple, like car indicators and implementing it into a bike helmet. It showed innovation as it was taking something simple and iterating it for use when biking.

<br>

## The Idea

<br>

With my research case study completed, it informed me with what direction that I wanted to take my prototype. I wanted to go beyond the bike helmet and create a wearable. I figured a jacket would make sense as the surface area for embedding LEDs is quite large and isn’t as restrictive such as a bike helmet. I also wanted to use flex sensors to activate the LEDs, which prompted the idea of putting it in the underarms of the jacket as cyclists tend to use arm gestures to indicate if he/she is going left, right, or stopping.

<br>

I had other ideas of using LED strips, but I felt using the individual Neopixel Floras and sewing them on with conductive thread would be easier as it can be very flexible when the cyclist moves around or does gestures. Along with using gaffer tape as a method to create the flex sensor, I felt that I would be in good shape in creating the prototype.

<br>

## The First Prototype

<br>

My first prototype was just a simple circuit and looking in how to piece together the entire prototype. At first, I was going to use an Arduino but I was recommended to use a Teensy instead. Simply put, the Teensy was a whole ton better due to it’s increased processing power. In addition, it came in a small package, so it was very easy to embed it into a jacket’s pocket or place it somewhere hidden (with a battery bank).

<br>

Using the Teensy was interesting as it took a bit of time to get used to due to it’s pin outs. As I realized when I started tinkering with it, it was simply an Arduino but powerful and has different use cases.

<br>

<br>

I started prototyping my initial version with using a Neopixel Flora and a flex sensor that I created in project 1. The circuit was simple enough as it was simply bending the flex sensor to activate the LEDs.

<br>

This prototype made me aware a few things:

- I may need a lot of individual Neopixels that are scattered around for the jacket. Approximately 8, I felt would but a good number but more may be needed depending on how far I want to take the prototype.
- Powering the LEDs maybe an issue but I could power them seperately with a battery bank.
- I would probably need a way to attach the flex sensor as well.
- This also provided insight regarding the flex sensor and using LED strips as well, but I figured the Floras would be appropriate for this use case.

<br>

## Building the Final Prototype

<br>

Building the final prototype was rather… Challenging. Ultimately, there were a few problems regarding it:

<br>

>The first problem: Unfortunately, sewing on the Neopixels takes a while as I had to re-sew a few things due to the threads shorting each other when the sleeve is moved.

<br>

I felt that this was the most challenging aspect as the thread must not come close to each other. During testing, the LEDs were not lighting up properly. I figured that perhaps it was the threading or how I sewed. Although, with further research – I realized that it maybe the type of thread where it isn’t bringing enough voltage to many LEDs. Then again, looking at tutorials, it seemed that the type of thread that I used would be able to power multiple Floras. It is possible that the fabric (it's made from teflon material) on the jacket maybe interfering with the conductive thread. Comparing this to my LED strips which are connected with wires, there wasn’t an issue at all.

<br>

<br>

Another issue was powering the LEDs, since I was using the Floras, 3.3 volts should work. This was working with the first prototype, as it was working with 3 volts and also 5 volts as well. In the end, I tried 3 volts, which worked good but the 4th LED did not properly light up but rather flickering with different colours. Which came to another issue where when I started lighting them up, I started to smell something burning off them. Was it the conductive thread? I wasn’t sure but something definitely was going on.

<br>

>Second problem: I didn’t have enough LEDs

<br>

With the issue of the Floras, I immediately had to figure out another alternative. Since I had only 4 on hand and the 8 remaining did not come in time in the mail, I found some LED strips that I used for another project and cut them into individual pieces and wired them up. I felt that using these LEDs were a lot easier because they were simple to wire and power as well. The downside is that it was a bit rigid so it can't be bent too much otherwise the solid core wire would snap. If I used flexible wire, perhaps it would be a little bit better.

<br>

>The third problem: How to set the LEDs up

<br>

With the LED’s solved, I created two strips of LEDs. One strip for the middle of the back and the other strip that goes from the back to the right arm (as the left arm was occupied with Floras that I didn't remove). The middle strip would act as a filler light, that would be red. While the right strip would be the right indiciator which will be activated by the flex sensor.

<br>

>The foruth problem: Making the actual prototype

<br>

Making the prototype took a bit of time as I also needed to make the flex sensor. At the end, I simply taped it on the jacket but if I had a bit more time – I would sew it on for maximum flexibility with the jacket. The LEDs were also attached with gaffer tape, as it proved to be a great adhesive with the jacket. It’s a little bit rough but it still a good way to attaching it rather than sewing it on.

<br>

## The Final Final Prototype

<br>

The resulting product I felt was a little subpar, I really wanted the Floras to work but due to perhaps the thread used or maybe how I sewed it – I was not able to get it to work along with my other LEDs. Although, I managed to get it working with the rest of the LEDs I had left over.

<br>

<br>

The final prototype provides a good look at what I wanted to do, and I felt that accomplishes it effectively. If I had enough LEDs, I would be able to make the left arm light up as well.

## The Take Aways

<br>

In the end, I felt I properly learned about prototyping with the trials and errors that come along with it. Mid way during prototyping, I had to change directions due to issues that appeared without notice. Originally, I thought it would work but, in the end, – It really didn’t. I learned how to deal with limited resources due to the pandemic, as things are harder since I can’t 3D print things or be able to troubleshoot in person. 

<br>

If resources weren’t an issue and there wasn’t a pandemic, I would go further:

<br>

-	I would make the LEDs modular so you can insert them into individual pockets in the jacket
-	A wiring system that complements with the modular LEDs, perhaps using copper tape and magnets
-	Finding a way to insulate the wiring and separate it from the jacket
-	Making the entire rigging flexible
-	Perhaps using different types of lighting like EL wire

<br>

Overall, this project I would say is my ambitious project to date yet and I learned a bit regarding prototyping and using research to make informed decisions in how I would visualize my final prototype. Despite the issues, I think the most important thing that I learned is that it takes time, effort, and trial and error, to make a product.
