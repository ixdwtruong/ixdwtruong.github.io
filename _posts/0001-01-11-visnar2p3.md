## Data Visualization 1: Kills vs Deaths by Team in 2018 CDL Playoffs

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0000_Layer 10.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/3_16153519202470/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/cdl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://github.com/Activision/cwl-data">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b>
This chart shows the relationship between deaths and skills by teams during the 2018 Call of Duty League playoffs. The pattern here is simply that the top teams who do better gets more kills as times goes on. This can be attributed to many factors like confidence over time, tactics/strategy, team composition, practice and etc.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b>
I picked a scattered plot graph because I wanted to compare the deaths and kills, showing the relationship between them and how the top teams perform overtime during the playoffs. I feel that it's a good chart to use to show this kind of data as you can see that certain teams are dying more than killing (or winning).

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this chart, it shows the objective time per map by team. Objective time is the time the team spends to progress the objective. We can see here that teams who have a short objective time, tend to win the map overall. This is because that the shorter the objective time, it would mean that the team is completing the objective faster, which in essence winning the fights and possibly the map.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I chose this graph because I wanted to show the spikes over a period of maps, which worked really well as you can see some teams performed better on some maps and others quite bad. You can also see which teams are strong in particular maps, and which teams don't perform as well in other maps.

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
This chart shows the total eliminations by team in the 2018 OWL Playoffs. The pattern here is that the more eliminations from a team, the better they due to overwhelming the opponent easily.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I picked a very simple bar chart here to show the number of kills. Other charts that I tried didn't show it well as kills is a purely numbers game than anything else.

## Data Visualization 4: Champion bans in 2020-2021 from all Professional Games in League of Legends

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0003_Layer 7.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/4_16153551494410/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/2020_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir_20210302.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
There's not really a pattern here but it seems that most of the champions being banned are the ones who work well with other specific heroes. Usually banning a champion indicates that the champion itself is not balanced or deemed too "meta" for the game.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I picked a tree graph because I wanted to show what characters are picked the most in regard to character bans. Using a bar chart could be possible but with a lot of characters, it could be overwhelming. Using a tree graph, you can instantly see which characters are picked the most by colour and size.

## Data Visualization 5: Professional Counter-Strike Players by Country who participated in Professional Games from 2015-2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0004_Layer 6.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/cs%20professional%20matches%20from%202015%20-%202020.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mateusdmachado/csgo-professional-matches">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
The patterns identified here is that majority of professional Counter Strike professional players come from the United States, some parts of Europe and the East (notably China and South Korea). This aligns with the current E-Sports scene as majority of players come from these specific countries.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this chart, I selected a map to represent countries. Since the dataset was separated into countries, I wanted to show this in a visually appealing way. With a lot of countries in the dataset, using a pie chart or bar chart, would be very overwhelming.

## Data Visualization 6: Ultimate Kills in 2018 OWL Playoffs by Player

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0005_Layer 5.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/6_16153584002250/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this graph, the interesting pattern here is that the ultimates that players use during the playoffs are ultimates that can instantly kill an entire team. Such ultimates like Dragonstrike, Dragonblade, or Self-Destruct, can change the match quite drastically.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this chart, I selected a bubble chart because I wanted to depict the number ultimates used per player and by character. I wanted to show what ultimates were more effective than others, which the bubble chart shows quite well with the size of the circle.

## Data Visualization 7: Total Earnings in E-Sports by Genre from 1998 to 2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0006_Layer 4.jpg)

<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this chart, the pattern here is that online games have the most total earnings in E-Sports. This is interesting as other games like fighting or collectible card games, should have the most earnings but in-fact they don't.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this chart, I went with a simple pie chart because the dataset is showing money and it's easy to digest the information. From the chart, you can easily see that Multiplayer Battle Arena type games have the largest E-Sport earnings.

## Data Visualization 8: Twitch Average Views by Game from 365 Days

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0007_Layer 3.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/Most%20watched%20games%20on%20Twitch%20-%20365%20days.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://sullygnome.com/games/365/watched">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
The pattern here is that the games that have the highest views are online or E-Sports titles.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this graph, I struggled a bit in showing the data. I tried different ways like a line graph or scatter plot, but I found a bar graph worked very well due to the amount of information being showed.

## Data Visualization 9: E-Sports Earnings by Country and Game From 1998 to 2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0008_Layer 2.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/e-sports_highest_earning_players.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
We can see here in the chart that the countries that earns the most from E-Sports is China, South Korea, and the United States. This still is true today as majority of E-Sports players come from either United States, South Korea, and China.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this graph, I used a stacked bar chart because of the multiple games per country. Using a normal bar chart wouldn't work just as well due to so many games and countries. I felt that using a stacked bar chart was the best because you can easily see what games are very popular in a country.

## Data Visualization 10: Twitch Overwatch Average Concurrent Viewers by Month

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0009_Layer 1.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/10_16160192472750/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/overwatch_twitch_stats.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/488552">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
The pattern here is that the spikes indicate either an event that is happening, that causes the spike in views. That could come from players gaining rewards from watching streamers or the game's popularity due to certain factors like E-Sports.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this graph, I selected a line graph because it was showing average views over a period. This represented the data better than something like a bar chat, plus I feel following a line chart is easy as you can see the peaks and valleys of the data.

## Theoretical Framework

![image](/images/framework.png)

-----

## Hypotheses Statements

1.	The E-Sports scene is dependent on the community of players, who are playing the game, which provides healthy competitions, tournaments, and such.
2.	E-Sports CAN influence viewers to play a specific game, buy merchandise, buy in-game items, or even the game itself.
3.	The country itself can affect how a game’s E-Sport scene can be dominant, such as China and Korea.
4.	Creating popularity or awareness of a game through E-Sports can prove to be advantageous in the long run and it creates stability for the game and the developers

## Process Documentation

Visualizations

There wasn't too much issues regarding my visualizations, as Tableau made things easy to visualize different charts. Although, choosing the chart was more of a challenge as I had to understand what chart I should pick. I eventually graviated towards simplier charts like bar, line, or scatter plots due to serveral factors. Dataset was a factor because, I wanted to show the data in it's simplest and easy to read form. Such things like kills from a game or earnings, were straight forward as I used bar graphs to display the increases, max or min values.

Theoretical Framework

From my initial three graphs, there wasn’t really a pattern or something that connects to each other. Although, it is clear from the graphs that the top teams gain a higher kill count compared to teams who are in the bottom. In a way, the framework can be made here:

Kills -> (increases) -> Players/teams ability -> (affects) -> Win or lose

In a way, it’s like how athletes do warmups when in sports. As the player gets situated in the situation or gets “into the groove” of things – Then they can perform better due to factors like adrenaline or confidence. It’s clear that this framework is fairly straight forward but fairly not substantial due to the graphs that I created. I decided to look in deeper in various aspects of E-Sports and if things like country, or even the game matters or not.

This led me to creating a new theoretical framework:

Country -> (affects) -> The game’s e-sport scene -> (increases) -> The visibility and competition of the game -> (affects) -> Players

This framework is based on the data that I gathered from various games in E-Sports. I noticed that most E-Sports players come from the United States, east Asia, and some parts of Europe. Notably, Korea and China have the most E-Sports players in the world. This can be sad that Korea has some of the skilled players in the world in different games like Overwatch, League of Legends, and Starcraft 2.

The pattern here is that a country can affect a game’s e-sport scene because it is dependent on the competition surrounding it which would affect players in the long run. Taking the example of Starcraft 2, where it had a huge E-Sport scene in South Korea which contributed to the game’s popularity all over the world. A few things happened within the scene which closed the leagues within South Korea in 2016, which brings us to today with Starcraft 2 being not so popular in the scene. This changed the landscape with other games like League of Legends becoming popular and shadowing Starcraft 2’s e-sport scene. As a result, players who played professionally in Starcraft, eventually moved to other games which led to its downfall in E-Sports. (Source: https://www.pcgamer.com/why-koreas-starcraft-ii-scene-has-crumbled/)

This goes to say that this framework isn’t very accurate but based on my findings and experiences, E-Sports tend to further popularize the game regarding sales, viewership on streaming platforms, and also the awareness. This led me to research more and find datasets relating to viewership and sales of video games and how E-Sports has affected games like Valorant, Overwatch, and more. This led me to creating a new framework:

E-Sports -> (affects) -> Video game sales -> (increases) -> Viewership of various streaming platforms -> (affects) -> The game’s awareness in the world/gaming community (i.e. popularity) -> (leads to) -> Attracting new players

In this new framework, I wanted to show the relationship that I found throughout my graphs. It’s not really that apparent since they seem to be separate but if looked deeper, there is a kind of patten that can be seen. The average Twitch views chart from 365 days (categories like Just Chatting or Special Events were removed as they are not game related) shows the highest viewed categories by game and the highest are from E-Sports titles. Games like Valorant and Overwatch, likely gained popularity due to events being held in the last 365 days (notably Overwatch League and various Valorant tournaments). This leads to the game gaining in popularity and in essence, leading viewers buying the game, in-game items, merchandise, and so on. This is reinforced by a paper by Joseph Macey, where he discusses the influences of E-Sports and game consumption. He says that “Esports is potentially one of the most important entry channels for the actual video game”, which is true as E-Sports gained massive popularity during the pandemic. (source here)

https://www.businessinsider.com/esports-ecosystem-market-report

This is shown by the graph that I’ve made using Twitch data of average concurrent views and it is clear that during the months of when Overwatch League is happening, there is a noticeable but small spike. For example, in 2019 when the season started in February 14th, views slowly trended upwards as the season continued until September 29th. The peak was in July 2019 and this was when the championships were happening, until September. Judging from the information and research that I found, it is possible or likely that these views influenced the game’s online presence both in-game and online. The fact that the game is still maintaining a lot of players (approximately 700 million across different platforms) shows that it is still popular even to this day.
