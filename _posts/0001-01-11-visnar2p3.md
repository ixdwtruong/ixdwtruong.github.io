## Data Visualization 1: Kills vs Deaths by Team in 2018 CDL Playoffs

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0000_Layer 10.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/3_16153519202470/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/cdl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://github.com/Activision/cwl-data">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b>
This chart shows the relationship between deaths and skills by teams during the 2018 Call of Duty League playoffs. The pattern here is simply that the top teams who do better gets more kills as times goes on. This can be attributed to many factors like confidence over time, tactics/strategy, team composition, practice and etc.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b>
I picked a scattered plot graph because I wanted to compare the deaths and kills, showing the relationship between them and how the top teams perform overtime during the playoffs. I feel that it's a good chart to use to show this kind of data as you can see that certain teams are dying more than killing (or winning).

## Data Visualization 2: Objective Time by All Heroes in the 2018 OWL Playoffs by Team

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0001_Layer 9.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/2_16153466103680/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this chart, it shows the objective time per map by team. Objective time is the time the team spends to progress the objective. We can see here that teams who have a short objective time, tend to win the map overall. This is because that the shorter the objective time, it would mean that the team is completing the objective faster, which in essence winning the fights and possibly the map.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I chose this graph because I wanted to show the spikes over a period of maps, which worked really well as you can see some teams performed better on some maps and others quite bad. You can also see which teams are strong in particular maps, and which teams don't perform as well in other maps.

## Data Visualization 3: Total Eliminations by Team in the 2018 OWL Playoffs

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0002_Layer 8.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
This chart shows the total eliminations by team in the 2018 OWL Playoffs. The pattern here is that the more eliminations from a team, the better they due to overwhelming the opponent easily.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I picked a very simple bar chart here to show the number of kills. Other charts that I tried didn't show it well as kills is a purely numbers game than anything else.

## Data Visualization 4: Champion bans in 2020-2021 from all Professional Games in League of Legends

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0003_Layer 7.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/4_16153551494410/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/2020_LoL_esports_match_data_from_OraclesElixir_20210302.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
There's not really a pattern here but it seems that most of the champions being banned are the ones who work well with other specific heroes. Usually banning a champion indicates that the champion itself is not balanced or deemed too "meta" for the game.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
I picked a tree graph because I wanted to show what characters are picked the most in regard to character bans. Using a bar chart could be possible but with a lot of characters, it could be overwhelming. Using a tree graph, you can instantly see which characters are picked the most by colour and size.

## Data Visualization 5: Professional Counter-Strike Players by Country who participated in Professional Games from 2015-2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0004_Layer 6.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/5_16153562434380/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/cs%20professional%20matches%20from%202015%20-%202020.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mateusdmachado/csgo-professional-matches">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
The patterns identified here is that majority of professional Counter Strike professional players come from the United States, some parts of Europe and the East (notably China and South Korea). This aligns with the current E-Sports scene as majority of players come from these specific countries.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this chart, I selected a map to represent countries. Since the dataset was separated into countries, I wanted to show this in a visually appealing way. With a lot of countries in the dataset, using a pie chart or bar chart, would be very overwhelming.

## Data Visualization 6: Ultimate Kills in 2018 OWL Playoffs by Player

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0005_Layer 5.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/6_16153584002250/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/owl_2018_playoffs_cleaned.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://overwatchleague.com/en-us/statslab">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this graph, the interesting pattern here is that the ultimates that players use during the playoffs are ultimates that can instantly kill an entire team. Such ultimates like Dragonstrike, Dragonblade, or Self-Destruct, can change the match quite drastically.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this chart, I selected a bubble chart because I wanted to depict the number ultimates used per player and by character. I wanted to show what ultimates were more effective than others, which the bubble chart shows quite well with the size of the circle.

## Data Visualization 7: Total Earnings in E-Sports by Genre from 1998 to 2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0006_Layer 4.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/e-sports%20earnings%20from%201998%20to%202020.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
For this chart, the pattern here is that online games have the most total earnings in E-Sports. This is interesting as other games like fighting or collectible card games, should have the most earnings but in-fact they don't.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this chart, I went with a simple pie chart because the dataset is showing money and it's easy to digest the information. From the chart, you can easily see that Multiplayer Battle Arena type games have the largest E-Sport earnings.

## Data Visualization 8: Twitch Average Views by Game from 365 Days

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0007_Layer 3.jpg)

<b>Link to Visualization:</b> <a href="https://public.tableau.com/profile/wilson.truong#!/vizhome/8_16155301397100/Dashboard1">Here</a> <br>
<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/Most%20watched%20games%20on%20Twitch%20-%20365%20days.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://sullygnome.com/games/365/watched">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
In this chart it shows the average of Twitch views chart from 365 days (categories like Just Chatting or Special Events were removed as they are not game related)  and shows the highest viewed categories by game. This leads to the highest average views are from E-Sports titles. Games like Valorant and Overwatch, likely gained popularity due to events being held in the last 365 days (notably Overwatch League and various Valorant tournaments). 

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this graph, I struggled a bit in showing the data. I tried different ways like a line graph or scatter plot, but I found a bar graph worked very well due to the amount of information being showed.

## Data Visualization 9: E-Sports Earnings by Country and Game From 1998 to 2020

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0008_Layer 2.jpg)

<b>Cleaned Dataset:</b> <a href="http://ixd1730.firebird.sheridanc.on.ca/data/e-sports_highest_earning_players.xlsx">Here</a> <br>
<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rankirsh/esports-earnings">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
We can see here in the chart that the countries that earns the most from E-Sports is China, South Korea, and the United States. This still is true today as majority of E-Sports players come from either United States, South Korea, and China.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
With this graph, I used a stacked bar chart because of the multiple games per country. Using a normal bar chart wouldn't work just as well due to so many games and countries. I felt that using a stacked bar chart was the best because you can easily see what games are very popular in a country.

## Data Visualization 10: Twitch Overwatch Average Concurrent Viewers by Month

![image](/images/vizinfop2_0009_Layer 1.jpg)

<b>Dataset Source:</b> <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/games/488552">Here</a> <br>
<b>Subject Category:</b> E-Sports

<b>Patterns Identified</b> <br>
The pattern here is that the spikes indicate either an event that is happening, that causes the spike in views. That could come from players gaining rewards from watching streamers or the game's popularity due to certain factors like E-Sports.

<b>Rationale for Type of Graph</b> <br>
For this graph, I selected a line graph because it was showing average views over a period. This represented the data better than something like a bar chat, plus I feel following a line chart is easy as you can see the peaks and valleys of the data.

## Theoretical Framework

![image](/images/framework.png)

With this theoretical framework, the idea is that E-Sports does have an impact on a game's popularity and gaining new players. This would give the developers of the game increased revenue from either game sales, downloadable content, in-game items/cosmetics, and so on. How this works is that new players would watch streamers or events like tournaments, which would influence them to either a) try out the game or b) buy merchandise because the game looks interesting. This is reinforced by a paper by Joseph Macey, where he discusses the influences of E-Sports and game consumption. He says that “Esports is potentially one of the most important entry channels for the actual video game”, which is true as E-Sports gained massive popularity during the pandemic (Macey). 

This is shown through the actual game's ecosystem in E-Sports. E-Sports contributes a lot of money, as shown by the various charts that I've created which can affect the game's development cycle of content and keeping it relevant in the scene (i.e. Overwatch creating new heroes to keep the game relevant). From an article from the Business Insider, Mariel Soto Reyes describes that E-Sports is "on track to surpass $1 billion in revenue for the first time this year [2021]" (Reyes). It's clear that with the pandemic, more people are continuing to explore the E-Sports landscape and finding new games to try through streamers, tournaments, and eventually physical events.

Another pattern that I've found is the charts that I've created. This is shown by the graph that I’ve made using Twitch data of average concurrent views and it is clear that during the months when Overwatch League is happening, there is a noticeable but small spike. For example, in 2019 when the season started on February 14th, views slowly trended upwards as the season continued until September 29th. The peak was in July 2019 and this was when the championships were happening, until September. Judging from the information and research that I found, it is possible or likely that these views influenced the game’s online presence both in-game and online. The fact that the game is still maintaining a lot of players (approximately millions across different platforms on activeplayer.io's "Overwatch Live Player Count and Statistics" page) shows that it is still popular even to this day.

## Hypotheses Statements

1.	The E-Sports scene is dependent on the community of players, who are playing the game, which provides healthy competitions, tournaments, and such.
2.	E-Sports CAN influence viewers to play a specific game, buy merchandise, buy in-game items, or even the game itself.
3.	The country itself can affect how a game’s E-Sport scene can be dominant, such as China and Korea.
4.	Creating popularity or awareness of a game through E-Sports can prove to be advantageous in the long run and it creates stability for the game and the developers

## Process Documentation - Visualizations

There weren't too many issues regarding my visualizations, as Tableau made things easy to visualize different charts. Although, choosing the chart was more of a challenge as I had to understand what chart I should pick. I eventually gravitated towards simple charts like bar, line, or scatter plots due to several factors. Dataset was a factor because I wanted to show the data in its simplest and easy-to-read form. Such things as kills from a game or earnings, were straightforward as I used bar graphs to display the increases, max, or min values.

![image](/images/screenshot1.png)

Forcing certain graphs onto the dataset, yielded odd results, although it was interesting how Tableau organizes the datasets and gives you the level of control needed to create something cool.

-----

## Process Documentation - Theoretical Framework

From my initial three graphs, there wasn’t really a pattern or something that connects to each other. Although, it is clear from the graphs that the top teams gain a higher kill count compared to teams who are in the bottom. This prompted me to creating a simple framework here:

![image](/images/framework2.png)

Kills -> (increases) -> Players/teams ability -> (affects) -> Win or lose

In a way, it’s like how athletes do warmups when in sports. As the player gets situated in the situation or gets “into the groove” of things – Then they can perform better due to factors like adrenaline or confidence. This framework is fairly straightforward but fairly not substantial due to the graphs that I created. I decided to look deeper into various aspects of E-Sports and if things like country, or even the game matters or not.

This led me to creating a new theoretical framework:

![image](/images/framework3.png)

Country -> (affects) -> The game’s e-sport scene -> (increases) -> The visibility and competition of the game -> (affects) -> Players

This framework is based on the data that I gathered from various games in E-Sports. I noticed that most E-Sports players come from the United States, east Asia, and some parts of Europe. Notably, Korea and China have the most E-Sports players in the world. This can be said that Korea has some of the skilled players in the world in different games like Overwatch, League of Legends, and Starcraft 2.

The pattern here is that a country can affect a game’s e-sport scene because it is dependent on the competition surrounding it which would affect players in the long run. Taking the example of Starcraft 2, where it had a huge E-Sport scene in South Korea which contributed to the game’s popularity all over the world. A few things happened within the scene which closed the leagues within South Korea in 2016, which brings us to today with Starcraft 2 being not so popular in the scene. This changed the landscape with other games like League of Legends becoming popular and shadowing Starcraft 2’s e-sport scene (Herrmann). As a result, players who played professionally in Starcraft eventually moved to other games which led to its downfall in E-Sports.

This goes to say that this framework isn’t very accurate but based on my findings and experiences, E-Sports tend to further popularize the game regarding sales, viewership on streaming platforms, and also the awareness. This led me to research more and find datasets relating to viewership and sales of video games and how E-Sports has affected games like Valorant, Overwatch, and more. This led me to create the proposed framework in this project.

## Challenges and Learnings

I think that this project allowed me to analyze and create something that a framework that I felt confident in. The challenge in this project was that I was always constantly feeling I was stretching the theories. Which made it hard to accept some of my theoretical frameworks. As I started to delve deeper into the research, my charts and also thinking further about the broader picture, I started to become more confident as there isn't a right or wrong answer.

Working on Tableau was very seamless with the workshop tutorials being available, although, I had some difficulty in creating some of the advanced graphs due to outdated tutorials. I feel that Tableau is a great tool and very much customizable but it has a huge learning curve in developing more advanced and visually appealing visualizations. I think that as time goes on, I'll get used to the program, just like any program out there.

I learned a bit about finding patterns in my charts, even though, it was hard to relate them to each other. I had to go and look for more datasets to reinforce my hypotheses and framework, including some research to support it. I found it challenging because, again, I felt I was stretching it too far with my theories but I think that anything's possible given that you support it with proper research. It is a hypothesis after all.

In the end, I enjoyed this project as I love looking at data visualizations and using that information to create theories or discover what is the narrative. I really liked using statistics from the games that I used as it showed a narrative throughout a match. I wished I delve even deeper into it but perhaps I can save that for the next project!
