## Overview/Design Statement

<br>
 
“The new normal” as most people might say. During the pandemic, the new normal was working from home, lockdowns and stay-at-home orders were a thing. It was clear that this took a mental toll on our health and especially on specific groups like the elderly. The elder population was hit the hardest, being the most vulnerable and at-risk, which posed challenges. Challenges like going outside or interacting with family members, which now, is replaced with virtual meetings in Facetime, Zoom, or Skype. In this project, the ideas from Projects 1 and 2 were taken but are focused on a specific audience that desires that social interaction. In project 2, hardware and IoT networks were used to produce a notification system for friends and family. In this case, the concept is similar but reaches a database of community members, volunteers, or social workers, that the elderly person can contact and socialize via phone or technology. As the pandemic continues, studies are emerging regarding the use of technology and the elderly. More technologies are being created specifically for this and creating that awareness of accessibility in the Elderly.
 
## The Idea
 
Using the ideas that were done in Project 2 and leveraging what was done in Project 3A, the concept was using a pinging system where the elderly person would press a button to get a social interaction via phone or digital. How would this work?

The idea is that it would ping to a central database of volunteers or social workers (or other people), which would notify them to contact the elderly person via their preferred choice of communication. It’s very similar to a call center, where one call routes to any call center agent that would pick up. In this case, it would be someone like a volunteer or a social worker, or a health professional.
 
## The research
 
Even though the idea was pretty sound, there were a few issues here:
 
1.	The elderly population doesn’t frequently use technology, lack that access, or learn it in some form (i.e. mobility, etc.)
2.	This leads to are they willing to learn the technology, are they currently using technology to communicate with others during the pandemic?
3.	Making it accessible would be good but can cost money
4.	What other technologies are there now? Pre and post COVID?
 
After some research, there were quite a bit of studies going on regarding the pandemic and mental health in the elderly:
 
Point 1: The elderly are adapting to today’s technology and the current pandemic.
 
A study by Bakshi and Bhattacharyya showed that the elderly that they interviewed are willing to learn the technology because of the pandemic and “the new normal” of social distancing and lockdowns (8). Although this study was conducted in India, the idea of the elderly being enabled by technology is evident through Canadian news. Furthermore, a paper by Moore and Hancock, recommended that families help their elderly family to get accustomed to technology and provide that technical support (3). From this, we can see that there are very many programs dedicated to helping the elderly in communicating with the outside world. Such as the Red Cross’ Friendly Phone Program that provides weekly check-ins with the elderly with volunteers. There are numerous initiatives that are going on within the city of Toronto dedicated to this also.
 
Point 2 and 3: Accessible technology 
 
With the pandemic, new technology came along catered to solving the issue of isolation and the elderly. A company in the UK called No Isolated created KOMP, a “one-button computer” that allows video chatting, photo sharing, and other social features. The accessibility features are great and simplified, and the security and privacy seem to be important to the company (as they mentioned on their website). Family (and possible friends) get access to the device via an app and can video call or share photos to the actual device.
 
## So what?
 
I think the research done provided a good insight into the conceptual product. As I saw, there is an actual product out there that is very similar to what I was thinking but I had issues with the KOMP:
 
1.	The issue of price is a huge problem as it’s around 500 Euros, which is $1,000 Canadian Dollars. Not every family can afford this and would be a huge cost in implementing it into retirement homes. Although, the pros do outweigh the cons as it provides an easy and simplified experience for the elderly to use technology to communicate with family/friends.
2.	The second issue is accessibility. In terms of the individual, not the product. What if the person doesn’t have a family? Or for whatever reason, they can’t get a hold of them? This doesn’t exactly solve the issue of that.
 
This made me think about my conceptual model and changing a few things based on my research:
 
1.	Making it affordable and easy to produce.
2.	Making the service more widely available instead of just family/friends
3.	Changing the overall pinging system to be two way instead of one way
4.	Reliance on existing systems/services like Zoom, Facetime, mobile, NGOs, etc.
 
Going through each of the points: 
 
Point 1 – Affordability and cost
 
By using low-cost components like a small OLED screen and open-sourced components, the manufacturing cost can be significantly lower since it is widely available. From the prototyping done in Project 1 and 2, it is possible to hit a sale price of $100 USD. This is considering other costs like R&D, services, and other things. I believe by making it cheaper, it’ll provide families or elderly individuals to purchase the device or even bulk purchase from retirement homes or the governments.
 
Point 2 – Services
 
Compared to the KOMP, it was designed for family/friend use only via an app. On my side, I would like to provide both levels of functionality to family and to other people as previously mentioned before. Family can be accessed via an app and, if the elderly person doesn’t have family, through various services like UHN’s Friendly Neighbour Hotline or other similar services. This in essence provides flexibility to the elderly individual, being able to call family or someone else.
 
Point 3 – Two-way communication vs. One way
 
My original idea was to do a one-way communication to a database, but I felt that having two-way communication would be ideal. The idea is to retain the original concept of the elderly person, hitting a button, and then pings to a database where a volunteer or social worker can “pick up”. Then as a reply, the volunteer or social worker then “pings” back to the device – Letting the elderly person know that someone will be talking to him/her soon.
 
Point 4 – Relying on existing systems and services
 
From an article by Arielle Townsend, with the pandemic, there were new services that were created specifically to combat isolation in the elderly. Such things as The Virtual Art Gallery, Friendly Neighbour Hotline, or Senior’s Centre Without Walls, are existing services created specifically for the elderly (Townsend). Instead of creating a self-reliant service that would cost a lot of money to maintain, I believe using existing services can reduce the cost down and also utilize expertise in that area.

## The End Result

In the end, my goal was to change the direction of projects 1 and 2 and focus it further. I felt that it was something that I achieved in this project utilizing recent research and studies revolving around the elderly and the pandemic. Does it solve all the problems? I don’t think so, but it uses a wide variety of things to address the issues. With the pandemic, we have a lot of time on our ends to learn something new and this was evident through the research as the elderly are willing to adapt and learn something new. These days, we can see through news outlets and even videos on YouTube about the elderly adapting to the pandemic and using technology to gather online, do things, and socialize.
