## Design Statement

<br>

In this project, it was an extension of project 1. The concept was to further develop what was done in project 1 with circuits but this time, using the Arduino to communicate with P5. As a group, we decided to go our individual ways as we all had different ideas on how to use the Arduino with P5. From switches to sounds, we all explored different ways of using P5 with the Arduino.

<br>

For this project, the focus was on developing different ways on how flex sensors can be used with P5. By using the P5 Serial app, many different things were created with sound and movement. The glove with flex sensors was brought back from Project 1 as there was potential in using the flex sensors to control different things in P5. Although, this came with many challenges and a few failures – Which were learning moments. As the project went towards the end, the realization of DIY flex sensors and its durability became true. In addition, understanding the limitations of the Arduino and what P5 can do – Made for wanting to use the Feather more.

## How to P5 (again)

<br>

Going into this project was a little bit daunting as I wasn’t very much familiar with P5 (still) and how Arduino communicates with it. As in Project 1, I focused on the circuit building and building sensors – I wanted Project 2 to be more P5 focused than anything. This got me to researching the potential that came out of the glove I created.

<br>

First thing that I did was to start off with something easy, I was able to control an led with the glove and then using P5 as a display monitor to see the values with a changing background (from an example in class)

<br>

I had several ideas using flex sensors, since I had 5 on the glove, my first idea was to use it as a controller of some sorts. I saw a P5 library called p5.EasyCam, which is a simple 3D camera control for 3D objects. I figured perhaps I can map certain gestures to specific controls. Although, as I started moving forward in figuring out how to make this happen – There were a few challenges:

<br>

* I realized that P5 doesn’t really have a way to map mouseX or mouseY. 
* The Arduino can’t be recognized as a peripheral input – Only some Arduinos can do this, from research.
* I needed some way to map the serial data to something like height and width.

<br>

This basically threw my idea out the window, as the Uno wasn’t capable as a peripheral input and P5 doesn’t let you re-map the mouse movement.

## Light at The End of The Tunnel

<br>

I started thinking about project 1 and how I used sound. I had another idea of what if I can use my glove and its flex sensors to adjust sound or frequency. This got me thinking and so without delay, I started to quickly get this working.

<br>

Although there was a challenge regarding code:

<br>

Understanding the code was a little bit hard as since I had 5 sensors, how do you make them all recognizable via P5? I remembered the button example and how it was using arrays. I figured, what if I put all the serial output values of each sensor on a line and get P5 to read a specific array? 

<br>

```css
if (sensors.length > 4) {
        thumb = map(sensors[0], 0, 350, 20, 30);
        index = map(sensors[1], 0, 450, 30, 40);
        middle = map(sensors[2], 0, 450, 40, 50);
        ring = map(sensors[3], 0, 450, 50, 60);
        pinky = map(sensors[4], 0, 450, 60, 70);
}
```

<br>

This worked pretty well! I managed to use an example from the P5 Sound library, using an oscillator as a base. I used two fingers to map out the oscillator frequency and the amplitude. The index finger was mapped to the frequency and the middle finger, the amplitude. This worked very well, which pushed the idea of what if I can use all my fingers to create sound.

## Even More Experiments

<br>

My original idea for controlling a 3D object still was in my head but even though it didn't work out, I wanted to try and attempt something similar. I figured that perhaps I could use the glove as a controller for a mini game. This was where I got the idea of using Daniel Shiffman's sketch of Snake (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMoVcohRgZA) and try to remap the controls to each finger.

<br>

>         //left
    if (thumb > 250) {
        snake.setDir(-1, 0);
    }
    
    //right
    if (index > 400) {
        snake.setDir(1, 0);
    }
    
    //down
    if (middle > 400) {
        snake.setDir(0, 1);
    }
    
    //up
    if (pinky > 400) {
        snake.setDir(0, -1);
    }

<br>

This worked relatively well but the end result was that it has a learning curve. I remapped the directions to each finger and as you bend a finger, it executes the direction. It took a bit of time to get used to this as you have to memorize which direction is which finger, and there was a considerable delay with the trigger of the flex sensor - Which made things rather hard to control.

<br>

I decided for my last experiment, I wanted to go back to using sound as a medium for P5. I was brought up with the idea of using the glove to change the pitch for a voice changer but I realized that it didn’t really have a P5 component, unless it was solely controlled by just P5 to the Arduino (instead of the Arduino to P5). Another issue was that the Adafruit Wave Shield, didn’t really support on the fly changes as it didn’t have enough ram (I explored this last year with my 3D Design project).

<br>

I had the idea of using the glove connected to a sound synthesizer, which each finger would have a different sound and as you move them, you can change the pitch/sound of whatever is being played. I found a resource (https://compform.net/music/p5_sound.html) that made a sound synthesizer from the P5 Sound library, which was really neat. I went on to mapping each of the fingers to a specific sound frequency and the results was a little subpar but regardless it worked nicely.

<br>

>         function draw() {
    background(50);

    //left
    if (thumb > 0) {
        const note = floor(thumb);
        synth.noteOn(note);
    } else {
        synth.noteOff();
    }

    //index
    if (index > 0) {
        const note = floor(index);
        synth.noteOn(note);
    } else {
        synth.noteOff();
    }

    //middle
    if (middle > 0) {
        const note = floor(middle);
        synth.noteOn(note);
    } else {
        synth.noteOff();
    }

    //ring
    if (ring > 0) {
        const note = floor(ring);
        synth.noteOn(note);
    } else {
        synth.noteOff();
    }

    //pinky
    if (pinky > 0) {
        const note = floor(pinky);
        synth.noteOn(note);
    } else {
        synth.noteOff();
    }

}

function serialEvent() {

    var inData = serial.readStringUntil('\r\n');

    if (inData.length > 0) {

        //so bascially splitting the data into an array
        var sensors = split(inData, ',');

        //put more arrays depending on how many fingers
        if (sensors.length > 4) {
            thumb = map(sensors[0], 0, 350, 20, 30);
            index = map(sensors[1], 0, 450, 30, 40);
            middle = map(sensors[2], 0, 450, 40, 50);
            ring = map(sensors[3], 0, 450, 50, 60);
            pinky = map(sensors[4], 0, 450, 60, 70);
        }
    }
}

<br>

I think that if I played around with the code a little bit more, I think I would be able to make it to produce a cleaner sound. Due to the values being mapped and the serial monitor constantly outputting data – The notes continuously play due to the bending of the flex sensor. Since there isn’t a “stop” button like a key where you can hold and release, it’s a bit difficult as there is a bit of variance for the flex sensor.

## The Takeaways

<br>

Overall, I learned quite a bit about the interaction between an Arduino and P5. The endless amount of possibilities is out there but I think that it’s restrictive to what P5 can do. In addition to the Arduino being wired and not wireless like the Feather, there are some limitations as well.

<br>

In addition to the hardware, I saw that my DIY flex sensors weren’t really that durable. The variance of the serial output really varied unless I controlled it via mapping certain value ranges. At one point, my thumb sensor started not working that well, which I presume, it was due to bending it so much. I feel if I had actual flex sensors, it would be very consistent, but the price is rather steep.

<br>

Despite the challenges, I do look forward to using different sensors in conjunction with P5 and the Feather. I see the wireless functionality in the Feather as a big step up in potential and what can be done with wearables especially. I also learned that DIY sensors does have its limits at time, although it was an achievement for me for getting it to run with numerous P5 sketches, but the durability is an issue.
