## (Not really a process doc but more of a documentation, a real case study process doc will be done for the final submission)

<br>

After the research case study and figuring out what I wanted to do, I went onwards to a hardware prototype. I was given the opportunity to use a Teensy instead of an Arduino, due to its size and processing power – So I thought it would be a great idea to delve in deeper in different microcontrollers in the physical computing world.

<br>

With the research case study, I was informed to go beyond further by using LEDs in a jacket to mimic car signals. Signals like brake, left and right indicators, for example. This required a simple circuit but with the resources that I had, I needed to make use of what materials that can be used to make this prototype come true.

<br>

First, I wanted to try out the Teensy and see what it was capable of. As per usual, I used a flex sensor to figure out how the Teensy outputs serial data and it seems to be very similar to what the Arduino does (but faster processing).

<br>

Afterwards, I went to more of a hardware prototype using individual Neo Pixel Floras to mimic the idea that I wanted to do.

From this prototype, it allowed me to realize a few things – Which affected my decisions for the v1.2 of the prototype:

<br>

*	From project 3, I realized that my DIY flex sensors are not durable – Two of my DIY flex sensors on my glove started to flake out. While using packing tape may be easy to do, but it is not flexible but rather rigid when bonded together. This got me thinking of using cloth tape – In this case, I had some gaffer tape lying around. I was also suggested hockey tape, which was a great idea as well.

<br>

*	Originally, I wanted to use RGB LED strips but now making this prototype – This would not be great as it wouldn’t be flexible at all. I saw that the individual Neo Pixel Floras can be sewed together but this resulted in sewing more Floras together. There are pros and cons of each thing but ultimately, I will be using the Floras as they are easy to sew on to a jacket and probably easy to power on.

<br>

With my learnings that came from the first prototype, it informed me in changing a few things that would make sense (with the resources I have at the moment). Off to the second and final prototype!
