## Overview/Design Statement

Using Project 1 as a foundation, we took the concept of an online/offline friend system and extended it further. The original hardware included Neopixel LEDs to show the friend or family that is online to use an OLED screen. This significantly reduced the size, which was the original goal from Project 1. By making the interaction even more meaningful and making it familiar like a phone notification, we think that it’ll provide another level of communication in our concept.

## Design Concept

<b>Use Case Explanation</b>

We named the device “Light” since the device “lights” up when someone is online. The concept is to let the user know that a friend or family member is online so that they can chat or interact with them. With the pandemic today, it’s getting difficult to find out if a friend or family member just simply wants to socialize and chat. By providing two methods of interactions, hardware, and software, it provides communication on both levels to let the user know that someone is available or even themselves.

The overall interaction is very simple as shown in the use case diagram. The user goes online or offline, then gets notified by both the web app and the device itself. This interaction is the same on the friend/family side.

<br>

## UX

The UX for Light has two different sides, one hardware, and the other software. On the hardware side, the interaction is using three physical hardware buttons on the side with the OLED screen. The OLED screen displays the notification, while the buttons allow the user to turn themselves online or offline.

The device is very much modular and can be used in different ways, using attachments that can change the functionality of the device. Users can attach a watch strap, a keychain holder, or even a clip, to provide flexibility for what the user wants.

<br>

On the software side, it is a very simple UI that uses bubbles as a form of interaction. The friend or family’s profile will be on the screen and to notify the user whether if someone is on, the friend or family member’s picture would have a coloured ring around them. This signifies that they are online and want to chat or socialize.

The user can also turn themselves on and off through the web app. The user is centered in the middle, while the friends/family is surrounding the user. The online/offline system is used for the user itself as well. We added more functionality like favourites and messaging. We wanted to keep it very simple because it can get very overwhelming if one person has a lot of family members or friends!
