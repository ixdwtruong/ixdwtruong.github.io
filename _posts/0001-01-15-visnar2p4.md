## Project Description

<br>

The project is an interactive installation/exhibit which revolves around educating the public about E-Sports and its industry. The location of the exhibit would be in various gaming conventions such as E3 and also E-Sports venues like the Overwatch League Homestands, BlizzCon, or The International. The focus is on these kinds of venues because of the subject matter and educating E-Sports to a greater public.
 
<br>
 
The exhibit has two main sections:
 
* The first section is all about the experience. The public gets to play against professional E-Sports players in different games (these games are scheduled by blocks). The aim is to show the average person, gamer, or whomever, that these players are very talented and work very hard to get where they are today.
* The second section is primarily about education and information. This is where the person would go and learn further about the industry, the statistics, and how it is changing. The point here is to dispel certain misconceptions and stereotypes, using statistics and data visualizations to show how the industry is a serious one and can compete with actual sports.
 
<br>
 
The data visualizations used are from Project 3, as I felt that I had enough data to show what I am envisioning for the concept. The data visualizations are used in mock-ups in the second part of the exhibit, where the person would interact and get information on the E-Sports industry. It’ll show a combination of a narrative (a day in the life of an E-Sports player) and supporting it with data visualizations on the industry. Ideally, if this was an actual project, there would be more data visualizations, but I used 5 data visualizations across six mock-ups.

I decided to use bar charts and bubble charts for my data visualizations because they are very easy to look at. I realized that most people have a perception of understanding graphs by the size of the data. For example, one of the mock-ups talks about money earned. This data is ordered from earnings from greatest to lowest. If a person would read this, they would immediately understand it quickly as the longest bar would mean that that person is making the most money and vice versa. The aim here is to provide a simplistic understanding of the data, if I were to use very complicated graphs, then I believe that the point would be harder to get across.

## User Experience and Interactivity

<br>

The intended users/audience is the general public, meaning that it can be anyone from gamers to parents to developers to your average person. My rationale for selecting a really broad audience is the big misconceptions and stereotypes in the E-Sports industry. It is often seen that “E-Sports is not Real Sports” or “Playing video games as a living isn’t a career.” The goal here is to educate the general public, meaning that your average person or even a parent with a child that is passionate about games.
 
<br>

How the person would interact with the data visualizations is through gestures. The concept is that the person would stand in front of a large screen and they would use hand gestures to move forward with the narrative. A camera (likely a Kinect camera) is used to detect those gestures and then registered as an input, which would move the current slide to the next slide. The level of interaction is very simple because I wanted the focus to be on the data visualization and the information being shown.

<br> 

As previously mentioned before, my goal for this project or interactive installation/exhibit is to educate the general public on E-Sports. As a fan of E-Sports and being interested in it for the last few years, I feel there is a lot of misconceptions and stereotypes about it. I want to influence others with my project that E-Sports is a legitimate industry that can rival actual sports. Not only this but to showcase the players being involved as they are very talented and with a little bit of effort, can be a career path for some.

## Process Documentation

<br>

My overall process for Project 4 was straightforward, which included a lot of ideation and refinement of those ideas which turned into what it is for the final deliverable. I had quite a few ideas that I thought up with like:

<br>
 
* Using projection mapping and making the data visualization interactive
* Interactive dashboards that are crowd controlled by an app, which the result would be a product for venues and offices
* An interactive installation using real data and projection mapping
 
<br> 
 
Even though these ideas were sound, the challenge was thinking about how realistic they are. I eventually settled on an interactive installation/exhibit but with the feedback that I’ve given, I had to think about the current state of the world and the pandemic. Not being able to interact with others, touch certain things, and even considering other forms of interactions. Although, this feedback was great – It hindered my thinking as it was quite limiting. 

<br>

This was where I had the idea of putting “assumptions” that simulated a “what if” the world didn’t have a pandemic and it was normal? This was where I created three assumptions

<br>

1.	No COVID
2.	Interactions of any kind are fine (i.e. touching something, etc.)
3.	Events and conventions are good too

<br>

Adding these assumptions really opened doors with my idea of doing an interactive installation. I took the opportunity to do quite a bit of research which I found IBM’s Think Exhibit at the Lincoln Center in New York, from 2011. The exhibit showed IBM’s work within the science and IT area. It had a big data wall that streams live data from different external sensors and visualizes this data in different forms. The main inspiration was how they structured the overall exhibit where there were two parts: one that is interactive that shows information and the other is the data wall. I wanted to incorporate this in my own way, which can be seen in the result of the project.

<br> 

This exploration of different exhibits and how they use interactions (including the IBM exhibit) inspired me to create two separate sections of the exhibit. The topic area that I used was E-Sports and I wanted a way to educate the public in a manner that they could understand. I started to think about my own experiences as someone who recently got into viewing E-Sports and that was wanting to experience playing against or with professional E-Sports players. I realized through watching the Overwatch League that these young adults are very talented and are comparable to actual sports players. This was where I asked the question, why not let the public experience it for themselves? It would show how talented these players are and then they can experience the other half of the exhibit with the data visualizations and information.

<br>

I think structuring it this way can provide a few things:

<br>

1.	It reinforces the first half of the exhibit by providing data and info, which would enable the person to connect the dots to the industry and how it is growing
2.	The appreciation for the players and how hardworking they are to make this a viable career path
3.	Dispelling certain misconceptions and stereotypes through data and statistics

<br>

## Learnings and Challenges

<br>

In Project 4, there were challenges but also learnings that came out of the final deliverable. Some of the challenges that I faced were:

<br>

<b>1. Picking one good idea among the many that I had</b>

<br>

I felt that this was the most challenging aspect of the project because it was very open-ended. I had the freedom to do an installation, dashboard, a physical item (which I considered), or even a service, which I had ideas for. Although, what made me pick the idea that I went to for this project was scope. I had to think about the data visualizations that I had that I could use and of course, the topic. Once I narrowed down what topic I wanted to do (I was going to pivot but didn’t in the end), the ideas became more focused as I started to think about what I could do with the data visualizations.

<br>

<b>2. Being realistic</b>
 
<br> 
 
With the pandemic, I think that we’re all designing within mind the constraints of COVID-19. Things like not being able to interact or touch things were difficult to create ideas around. Even though, there are fantastic ways that are interesting to combat this, like using a car to perform the interaction. This was another challenge, but I faced it by creating assumptions, which made things a whole lot easier. I do believe that designing under constraints is great, it forces you to become more creative with your solutions but as I narrowed down my options and topic – This wasn’t possible due to the subject area that I wanted to do.

<br>

Even though there were challenges, learnings were made in the project:

<br>

<b>Learning 1:</b>

<br>

Through my research and exploration, I learned that data visualization can interact in many forms. From physical objects, drawings, installations, art, and even digitally. Exploring different aspects of interacting with data visualizations like IBM’s exhibit in New York, gave me inspiration and be unique with my project idea.

<br>

<b>Learning 2:</b>

As with any project, overcoming the struggles and learning from them was rewarding. After I solved my problems of limiting my idea, everything came into place as I started making my mock-ups and using my data visualizations to create the interactions.
