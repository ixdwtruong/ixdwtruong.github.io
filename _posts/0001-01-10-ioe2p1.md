Overview/Design Statement

Learning about IoT (Internet of Things) through physical computing provided a lot of different possibilities using the Arduino Feather Huzzah which lead to the ideation of many concepts. Although, through developing these ideas was a challenge due to the limited resources that were available during the pandemic. Such ideas like a module that detects distance of objects when riding a bike or a monitor that displays stress, there was always the question about the “meaningful” connection between the user and the device. This led to working with a partner (Alexandria Legere) which she had an idea of using leds that would indicate to friends/family that they are available to chat. This was interesting as with the pandemic, social interactions are limited, and it can be hard for those who are social to be isolated in these times. Combining each of our strengths in hardware and coding, we set out to build something that would be quite meaningful and would create that connection – Whether if it was during a pandemic or not.

Ideation and failing

At the beginning of the project, I didn’t really know what to think about for my overall concept. I thought about IoT and what it can enhance in my life but when you are sitting at home all day, it’s rather hard to think of things that can use IoT. I started to think about my past experiences in cycling (this was something I did last term as a topic too) and thought about what problems I had in that overall space.

I thought about the distance between myself and other things like cyclists, cars, animals, people and realized that the several times (many) that I almost got swiped by a car, almost got doored, or a random person on the bike trail. This prompted me to do the Framework for Interactions that was in the lecture slides, to give me a better understanding of what interactions are there when I am cycling.

This gave me an idea of creating a module that attaches to your bike which ultimately detects distance via an ultrasonic sensor. The data being gathered is feed into Arduino and shown through P5 which tells the cyclist that there is something ahead of them (or at the side). The idea is to provide the cyclist safety and being predictive when encountering danger like a car being too close or another cyclist. Using a ultrasonic sensor made a lot of sense due to the distance that it can output, since it is recommended that cyclists have 2m of distance surrounding themselves – I figured that it would be a good choice.

Rise and downfall

I thought my idea was great but eventually encountered challenges:

1.	Using an ultrasonic sensor was not reliable due to the sensor itself. Using it in an Arduino can be very difficult and I’ve read online (and heard inclass) that these sensors are not reliable in collecting distance information.
2.	I looked into other sensors like LIDAR but they were quite expensive and even if I were to buy one, shipping would be heavily delayed due to the pandemic
3.	The last thing was, what meaningful connection would it make to the cyclist? What would be the cultural implications? The answer to these questions really leads to nowhere as I thought it would provide some level of safety, but it really didn’t. Such an item can’t really predict if a car is coming or someone is on the bike trail, a cyclist is always aware of their surroundings and having that information on a phone isn’t really intuitive. 

I had other ideas of IoT devices like using a heart rate sensor to detect stress, which outputs to a P5 sketch which shows family or friends that they shouldn’t be disturbed. Heart rate isn’t a good measurement of stress and I did investigate EEG devices, but they weren’t supported too well by the Arduino community.

So, the question begs, what is next? I realized that I’m running out of ideas and I was having difficulty in the coding/P5 aspect of the project. This led me to working with Alex L. as she had a good idea and her strength was more in the coding/P5 aspect of the project. This got me working with her because for myself, I was strong in creating interactions with physical computing than P5.

The Idea (and prototyping)

Alex’s idea was to create a device that lets friends or family know that they want to chat or talk. Using LEDs as a form of notification and a UI on P5, I thought it was interesting as with the pandemic and social isolation – People need to find a way to be social and talk about certain things like various issues or simply wanting to bond with one another.

I started immediately prototyping using the guides that were posted in class. I started learning about how the Feather Huzzah worked and the idea of sending serial data to the Adafruit servers. I initially used white LEDs to display the interaction but I figured quickly using Neopixels were the way to go as they are RGB, so you can set any colour you wanted.

With my first prototype, I used the guides as a starting point and used Neopixels instead of a white LED. This involved using a button, which worked as I wanted the user to press the button whenever the user wants to tell friends/family that they want to talk. The challenge with Neopixels is that they use the Neopixel library which is harder to implement (cause RGB) compared to a typical white LED. There were power problems as well since the Feather outputs 3.3v, I could only use a maximum of 2 Neopixel Floras, rather than the 3 that I initially wanted.

Putting it all together

I successfully managed to get a prototype working with the Neopixels and the next step was to figure out a housing for the entire system. My idea was to make it as portable and small as possible, as I wanted to provide the user flexibility in where he/she would want to put it. The idea is that you can attach it to yourself, stick it on a wall, put it behind yourself, or even on a hat. The possibilities are endless because I wanted it to be used in daily life where you can tell people that you can be approached and chat with.

The challenge was making it work with the provided examples of code and the Neopixel, since the Neopixel uses different code than normal LEDs – I had to take a little more effort in getting it to work. The other challenge was trying to find a good portable enclosure that I can put it in. Since there was a lot of wiring, I reduced the wiring by making the lines smaller and that helped quite a bit. I experimented with different housings from using a small box that was from my Arduino Uno to a plastic small container. Each enclosure worked to an extent, but I wanted it to be smaller.

In the end, I used a small box that I found from my Nintendo Labo set – Which worked really well although I had to push the wires a little bit, but I got it working.

Working Together

Working with Alex was a treat as she was more skilled in coding with P5 and Javascript, so I didn’t have to worry too much about that. Since the hardware side of things was what I did best, I didn’t have too much issues. The main challenge was putting it together as we encountered a few things like feed problems and getting it work remotely with the web UI. Majority of these issues were resolved as Alex worked through my code and tweaked so that it would work with her stuff (the UI).

I eventually decided to change how the Neopixels worked and separated them instead of having them together in one data line. The original prototype had the two Neopixels combined so there wasn’t too much flexibility when a friend/family is online, it would overlap the user’s light (if that makes sense). To separate the Neopixels, I put each of them on a separate data pin on the Arduino. One being on 13 and the other being on 12. This allowed the user and friend/family Neopixel to be ran on the same time, which provided better flexibility when the user decides to turn their light off.

The End Result

Even though Alex was working on the UI for our idea, I still prototyped a simpler version of the user interface. This was to show that the concept worked but it was still a little buggy as the code was interfering with the two feeds that were happening at the same time (the physical button and the button on the sketch). To resolve this, I used different values which worked somewhat well, but it was still slow due to the Adafruit servers throttling the amount of data being passed through. I think that it’s a limitation to using a free account, but overall, it worked quite well. 

The end result of the project was something great, it worked at the end with some modification that Alex had one with integrating my Arduino code with her building the overall UI interface. To make it a little bit better, I mocked up how it would look like – Which in reality, if this were an actual product, would look really good!

The Takeaway

Other than learning about the Feather and IoT, I think the most important lesson that I learned through this project is collaboration. In different group projects, I was the one who led the team and imposed my ideas strongly. I understood the strengths in the peers that I worked with and utilized their strengths to the fullest for my own ideas. Although, through last semester, the word “true collaboration” popped up and I started thinking about the meaning of it. What is collaboration? From working with Alex, I started to understand that meaning as we had our strengths and weaknesses, but the result was creating something that we both couldn’t do if we didn’t work together. I was very happy with what we made for the project and I wouldn’t hesitate working with her again if I was able to.
